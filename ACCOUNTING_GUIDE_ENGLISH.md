# Accounting Guide - Gold Loan Business
## Complete Guide to Double-Entry Bookkeeping

---

## Part 1: Basic Concepts

### Double Entry System

**Golden Rule:** Every transaction has TWO sides

Money doesn't just appear or disappear - it always comes FROM somewhere and goes TO somewhere.

**Example:**
- If you give a ₹10,000 loan
- Where did money come from? → Your cash box (Cash in Hand)
- Where did money go? → To customer (Loans Receivable)

---

## Part 2: Account Types

### 1. Assets - What You Own

**Cash in Hand**
- Physical cash in your cash box
- Changes daily
- Account Code: 1001

**Loans Receivable**
- Money customers owe you
- Account Code: 1201

### 2. Capital/Equity - Owner's Investment

**Capital**
- Owner's investment in business
- Changes only when owner adds/withdraws money
- Account Code: 3001

### 3. Income - What You Earn

**Interest Income**
- Interest earned on loans
- Your profit
- Account Code: 4001

### 4. Expenses - What You Spend

**Rent Expense**
- Office rent payments
- Account Code: 5001

---

## Part 3: Debit & Credit

### Simple Explanation:

**Debit** = Where money WENT / Asset increase
**Credit** = Where money CAME FROM / Asset decrease

### Rules:

| Account Type | To Increase | To Decrease |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Assets (Cash, Loans) | Debit | Credit |
| Capital (Owner's Equity) | Credit | Debit |
| Income (Interest) | Credit | - |
| Expenses (Rent) | Debit | - |

## Part 9: Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Why must Debit and Credit be equal?

**Answer:** Every transaction has two sides. Money moves from one place to another. Therefore, both sides must be equal.

**Answer:** Capital is the owner's investment. It doesn't change with daily business transactions. It only changes when the owner adds or withdraws money.

```
Debit:  Cash in Hand        ₹5,000
Credit: Interest Income     ₹5,000
```

### Q5: What if only principal is received?

**Answer:**
```
Debit:  Cash in Hand           ₹50,000

## Part 11: Understanding the Balance Sheet

### What is a Balance Sheet?

A snapshot of your business at any moment showing:
- What you OWN (Assets)
- What you OWE (Liabilities)
- What's YOURS (Equity)

### Formula:
**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

### Example Balance Sheet (After Day 8):

**ASSETS**
- Cash in Hand: ₹7,72,000
- Loans Receivable: ₹1,75,000
- **Total Assets: ₹9,47,000**

**LIABILITIES**
- (None in this example)
- **Total Liabilities: ₹0**

**EQUITY**
- Capital: ₹9,50,000
- Less: Drawings: ₹50,000
- Add: Interest Income: ₹7,000
- Less: Rent Expense: ₹10,000
- **Total Equity: ₹9,47,000**

**Total Assets (₹9,47,000) = Total Liabilities (₹0) + Total Equity (₹9,47,000)** ✓

## Part 12: Understanding Profit & Loss

### What is Profit & Loss Statement?

Shows your business performance over a period:
- How much you EARNED (Income)
- How much you SPENT (Expenses)
- What's LEFT (Profit or Loss)

### Formula:
**Profit = Income - Expenses**

### Example P&L (After 8 Days):

**INCOME**
- Interest Income: ₹7,000
- **Total Income: ₹7,000**

**EXPENSES**
- Rent Expense: ₹10,000
- **Total Expenses: ₹10,000**

**NET PROFIT/LOSS: -₹3,000 (Loss)**

## Part 14: Important Ratios

### 1. Cash Ratio
**Formula:** Cash in Hand ÷ Total Assets
**Example:** ₹7,72,000 ÷ ₹9,47,000 = 81.5%
**Meaning:** 81.5% of assets are in cash (very liquid)

### 2. Loan to Capital Ratio
**Formula:** Loans Receivable ÷ Capital
**Example:** ₹1,75,000 ÷ ₹9,50,000 = 18.4%
**Meaning:** 18.4% of capital is deployed in loans

### 3. Return on Capital
**Formula:** (Net Profit ÷ Capital) × 100
**Example:** (-₹3,000 ÷ ₹9,50,000) × 100 = -0.32%
**Meaning:** Currently making a small loss
